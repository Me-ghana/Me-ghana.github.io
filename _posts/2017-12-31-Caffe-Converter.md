This tutorial will explain how to use the Caffe to Tiny-DNN Converter

 The Caffe deep learning framework is often used in vision applications. However, if you have limited computation resources, you may want to use a different deep learning framework, such as tinyDNN. In my case, I would like to convert <a href = "https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365" target = "_blank"> MIT's Places365-CNN</a> caffemodel to tiny-dnn. This will allow MIT's model to run on the <a href = "http://jevois.org/" target="_blank">JeVois, a Smart Machine Vision Camera,</a> which has tiny-dnn support. I'll outline the steps I take below:
