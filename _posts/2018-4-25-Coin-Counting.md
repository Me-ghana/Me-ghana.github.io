title: Coin Counting with the JeVois
---

-Add Info-

This tutorial will help explain how to use OpenCV with a video stream to identify U.S. coins using image segmentation and blob detection.  I found the exercise of identifying U.S. coins to be a good introduction to some of the basic functions in OpenCV and some important computer vision algorithms.  

While this post explains how to use OpenCV with the [JeVois](http://jevois.org/), a smart machine vision camera, to count U.S. coins, you can use any video stream that is read image by image.
